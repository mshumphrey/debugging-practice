Clone this repository into your local environment and run it. It's meant to print out an X of x's, of size xSize, to the terminal, like this:
<pre>
x       x
 x     x
  x   x
   x x
   x x
  x   x
 x     x
x       x
</pre>
   
What actually happens?
Can you fix the code, so that it works as it's meant to?
